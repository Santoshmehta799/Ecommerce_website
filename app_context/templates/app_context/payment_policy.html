            Seventh Square strives to make the payment process easy, convenient & secure for both buyers and
            sellers.<br /><br />
            With our Payment Gateway partner, we are providing numerous payment methods for consumers
            including Credit Cards, Debit Cards, Net Banking, EMI, PostPaid Options, Mobile Payment Options and
            
            
            Cash-on-delivery (With Courier Partners).
            <br /><br />To simplify the process for the seller, we disburse the amount due to the seller straight to the
            seller’s bank
            Account through NEFT.
            <br /><br />
            ‘Net Payable Amount on an order’ to seller is the Total Order Item Value minus Seventh Square’s
            Marketplace Fee
            <br /><br />
            Marketplace Fee includes Marketplace Commission (varies as per the product category and type), Payment
            Processing Fee, Service Tax, Shipping Charges (if applicable) and any other charges as applicable
            <br /><br />
            Net Payable Amount is ‘available’ for transfer to the seller on successful delivery to the buyer, i.e. lapse
            of the return period after delivery (on delivery accepted by the buyer in case of non-returnable product). Any
            Order Amount from orders with disputes, complaints or return requests are held until the dispute is resolved
            and not available for transfer to the seller. Any Charges / Fee not described under the Marketplace fee (for
            example, Seller Cancellation Charges or Advertising fee) can be adjusted against the available amount in the
            seller’s account with Seventh Square.
            Total Available amount will be remitted on a weekly basis to the sellers
            <br /><br />
            As an introductory offer, Any available amount will be remitted to the seller within 1 working day (from the
            time it is marked as ‘available’).

            <br /><br />
            This offer can be offered to all or selected sellers and can be discontinued at the discretion of the
            platform. No claims can be raised based on the validity and eligibility for the offer.

            <br /><br />
            You can reach out to our team at <u>seller@seventhsq.com</u> for any
            queries regarding this policy.<br /><br />
